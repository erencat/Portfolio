# About Me
I am Navy Fellow here at Carnegie Mellon University's Institute for Politics and Strategy. I am spending the year learning ways to "demystify" seamingly complex technology to non-technical decision-makers.

# What I Hope to Learn
This semester, I am hoping to learn better ways to present complex data to senior decision-makers. My experience in the Navy has been limited to "stale" powerpoint slide shows - and I know that there must be better ways to quickly and efficiently present decision-makers so that they can understand the "full picture" and make informed decisions.

# Telling Stories with Data Portfolio
This is where I will post this semester's weekly assignments!
